                        Authors are required to clearly present the primary study findings in their manuscript. The text, tables, and figures should logically organize and display results, prioritizing the primary or most significant findings at the forefront. Tables should not merely replicate data already presented in the text but should complement and enhance understanding. Graphs and figures should be used effectively to highlight key findings and trends, supporting the narrative flow of the manuscript. This approach ensures that the manuscript effectively communicates the study's outcomes to the readership.<br />
                        <b> Results and Discussion:</b> In this section, the results should be evaluated for their validity and compared to relevant findings from other studies, using appropriate in-text citations. The significance and applicability of the results should be justified concisely, highlighting their importance. It's important to acknowledge any limitations of the methods used and suggest areas for further research. This discussion should be succinct yet comprehensive, providing a clear context for the findings and their implications.<br />
                        <b>  Conclusion:</b> This section should clearly outline the key findings of the research and provide a thorough explanation of their significance and applicability. It is an opportunity to discuss any recommendations arising from the study that have broader implications. Emphasis should be placed on how these findings contribute to existing knowledge, address gaps in understanding, and potentially influence policy or practice in the field. This discussion should be focused and directly connected to the results presented earlier in the manuscript, offering insights into the broader impact and implications of the study's outcomes. Cite references in this section.<br />
                        <b> Conflict of Interest:</b> In this section, authors are required to disclose any financial, institutional, personal, or other relationships that could potentially influence the findings or decision-making presented in the manuscript. It is crucial to declare any such associations transparently. If there are no conflicts of interest to declare, this should also be clearly stated to maintain transparency and uphold ethical standards in research publication. This disclosure helps readers and reviewers assess the objectivity and reliability of the study's findings and conclusions.<br />

                        <p>
                            Self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses their own previously published work without proper citation, presents existing content as new, or fails to credit the original source. Knowmed Publication considers self-plagiarism a form of plagiarism. For instance, if an author incorporates parts of their prior publication into a new manuscript without acknowledgment, it qualifies as self-plagiarism. To maintain originality and academic integrity, we provide Plagiarism X software to our editors and reviewers as part of our manuscript submission system.

                            Knowmed Publication is committed to maintaining high standards for all papers through processes such as plagiarism checks, peer review, copyediting, and formatting. Our team invests significant effort to uphold these standards. Therefore, withdrawal of an article during processing is highly discouraging. We strive to make the publishing process as smooth as possible for authors and, in return, expect full adherence to ethical guidelines. The following policy outlines our approach to article withdrawal:
                            <br /><br />  Requests for article withdrawal will be considered only if received within a week time of the article’s submission date or before the receipt of the copyright form, whichever occurs first. Withdrawal may be permitted if the reason provided is deemed valid. However, if Article Processing Charges (APC) have already been paid, they will not be refunded. Details of articles that are withdrawn or retracted for valid reasons will be published on our website.
